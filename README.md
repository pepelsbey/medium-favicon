# Medium Favicon

Smaller favicon for Medium.

- `favicon-old.ico` 90,022 bytes
- `favicon-new.ico` 27,438 bytes

See `source/*.png` for source images that were combined into the new favicon.ico.

I could only guess, but it seems that the reason of reduced file size is 8-bit PNGs instead of 24 or 32-bit ones.

And suddenly there’s a newer icon by [@cheeaun](https://twitter.com/cheeaun) made using [Greenfish Icon Editor](http://greenfishsoftware.blogspot.hu/2012/07/greenfish-icon-editor-pro.html):

- `favicon-newer.ico` 2,291 bytes
