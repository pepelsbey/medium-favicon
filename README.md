# Medium Favicon

Smaller favicon for Medium.

- `favicon-old.ico` 90,022 bytes
- `favicon-new.ico` 27,438 bytes

See `source/*.png` for source images that were combined into the new favicon.ico.

I could only guess, but it seems that the reason of reduced file size is 8-bit PNGs instead of 24 or 32-bit ones.
